Project contains a lot of skeleton classes that need to be filled in
Some classes are decently filled in though, such as HomeScreen or Login
Layouts are very rudimentary and need to be improved upon

I think nearly every screen should have the hamburger menu in the top left
this is referred to in the code as the nav drawer
this would make every screen kindve function as the home screen
where the homescreen is more of the first screen someone sees

every user can click on the coaches profile. if they are not a coach,
it gives them the option to create a coaches profile
to be a coach, a user should have a picture and bio

im storing a lot of stuff as files.
such as if the user is logged in
or their username
see FileUtils

there are comments at the top of every file
and some in the file as well

each screen has a layout that starts with activity
and one that starts with content. the content is where
most stuff is

google maps is only neccessary if a class is being run
in a public space that has no address
otherwise, the instructor should put the exact address
this is not uber. with uber, a client drops a pin and the driver
goes near there and then calls to find the exact spot
instructors arent going to be sitting by their phone
waiting for clients to call
theyre going to be setting up for their class
maybe even starting their class

i think the events should be shown in a list view
